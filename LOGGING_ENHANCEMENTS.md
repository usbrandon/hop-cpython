# Logging Enhancements for CPython Step

## Overview
We've added comprehensive logging throughout the Python session initialization process to help diagnose environment setup issues. These enhancements provide detailed information about each step of the initialization sequence.

## What's Been Added

### 1. Constructor Logging
- Logs when Python session is being initialized with command, server ID, and PATH entries
- Logs when installing Python scripts to temp directory
- Captures and logs any errors during script installation

### 2. Environment Check Logging
- Logs the Python command and script being used for environment check
- Captures both stdout and stderr from the environment check process
- Provides detailed output of environment check results

### 3. Server Socket Creation
- Logs when server socket is created and the port number assigned
- Logs the timeout value (12000ms)
- Logs when waiting for Python server connection
- Logs successful connections and any connection failures

### 4. Server Launch Process
- **launchServer()**: Logs all server startup parameters including:
  - Python command path
  - Server script location
  - Port number
  - Debug mode status
- **launchServerScript()**: Logs additional details for PATH-based launches:
  - Operating system type
  - Script file creation and location
  - Script execution permissions

### 5. Error Stream Capture
- Added threads to capture and log any error output from the Python process
- Errors are logged in real-time as they occur
- Helps diagnose Python-side issues during startup

### 6. Server Initialization Response
- Logs when connection is established
- Logs the Python server PID
- Logs Arrow support availability
- Notes when Arrow is requested but not available

## Log Levels Used

- **Basic**: Key initialization milestones and status information
- **Detailed**: Environment check results and additional context
- **Debug**: Verbose information for troubleshooting
- **Error**: Failed operations and error messages

## Example Log Output

```
Initializing Python session with command: python
Creating server socket...
Server socket created on port 38457 with timeout 12000ms
Running Python environment check using: python /tmp/pyCheck.py
Python environment check output:
Apache Arrow support is available (recommended for better performance)
Python environment check passed. Launching python
Starting Python server:
  Command: python
  Script: /tmp/pyServer.py
  Port: 38457
  Debug mode: false
Python server process started, waiting for connection...
Python server connected successfully
Connection established with Python server, receiving initialization response...
Python server initialized successfully:
  PID: 12345
  Arrow support: Available
```

## Benefits

1. **Easier Troubleshooting**: Clear visibility into each initialization step
2. **Error Diagnosis**: Capture Python-side errors that may not be visible otherwise
3. **Environment Verification**: Confirm that Arrow and other dependencies are properly detected
4. **Connection Issues**: Identify network or firewall problems preventing server connection
5. **PATH Issues**: Debug problems with Python virtual environments or custom installations

## Usage

The logging is automatically active when using the CPython step. To see detailed logs:
1. Set your Hop log level to "Basic" or higher for standard information
2. Set to "Debug" for verbose output including script contents
3. Check the Hop logs for any "Python server error:" messages which indicate Python-side issues
